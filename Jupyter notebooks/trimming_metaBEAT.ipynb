    "I will use metaBEAT, a tool tailored towards reproducible and efficient analyses of metabarcoding data that was developed by Christoph Hahn at University of Hull. The pipeline is still under active development and will likely be extended further in the future. The pipeline is available in a Docker container with all necessary dependencies. The Docker image is building on ReproPhylo.\n",

    "The data I will be analyzing are 12S rRNA sequences amplified from eDNA samples collected from ponds across the UK. The experiment was designed determine the sensitivity of eDNA metabarcoding for rare species, such as great crested newt, and assess the potential of eDNA metabarcoding to assess vertebrate community composition in freshwater ponds. \n",
    "\n",
    "The metaBEAT tool is designed as a wrapper around a complete analysis from raw data, performing (optionally) de-multiplexing, quality filtering, clustering along the way, to OTU tables in biom format. It currently supports BLAST, Kraken and phylogenetic placement (pplacer). Further approaches will be included in the future to allow for efficient and standardized comparative assessments of all approaches.\n",
